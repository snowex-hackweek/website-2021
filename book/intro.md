SnowEx hackweek was offered virtually July 12 - 16, 2021. The purpose of the event was to foster an environment of collaboration and sharing of [NASA SnowEx](https://snow.nasa.gov/campaigns/snowex) datasets across teams. We offered [tutorials](tutorials/index) on open source software and we participated in a variety of different [projects](projects/list_of_projects) work.
