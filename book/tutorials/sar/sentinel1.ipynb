    "\n",
    "Sentinel-1 is a constellation of two C-band satellites operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). *It is the first SAR system with a global monitoring strategy and fully open data policy!* S1A launched 3 April 2014, and S1B launched 25 April 2016. There are many observation modes for SAR, over land the most common mode is 'Interferometric Wideswath' (IW), which has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| wavelength | resolution | posting | frame size | incidence  | orbit repeat |\n",
    "| - | - | - |  - | - | - | \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most optical satellite observations, SAR antennas are pointed to the side, resulting in an \"line-of-sight\" (LOS) incidence angle with respect to the ellipsoid normal vector. A consequence of this viewing geometry is that radar images can have significant distortions known as shadow (for example due to tall mountains) and layover (where large regions perpendicular to incident energy all map to the same pixel). Also note that *resolution* != *pixel posting*. *resolution* is the minimal separate of distinguishable targets on the ground, and *posting* is the raster grid of a Sentinel1 image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [global observation plan](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario) for Sentinel-1 has changed over time, but generally over Europe, you have repeat acquisitions every 6 days, and elsewhere every 12 or 24 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite radar instruments record the *amplitude* and *phase* of microwaves that bounce off Earth's surface. These values can be stored as a single complex number, so you'll often encounter SAR images that store complex-valued arrays. {term}`InSAR`, or 'Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar', is a common processing pipline to generate phase-change maps or 'interferograms' (which can be related to tectonic surface displacements or snow properties) using two different SAR acquisitions.\n",
