    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning simply means building algorithms or computer models using data. The goal is to use these \"trained\" computer models to make decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a general definition;\n",
    "\n",
    "> Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel, 1959)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, ML algorithms have achieved great success in a wide variety of fields. Its success stories include disease diagnostics, image recognition, self-driving cars, spam detectors, and handwritten digit recognition. In this tutorial we will train a model using a SnowEx dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to build a computer model that returns 1 if the input is a prime number and 0 otherwise. This model may be represented as follows;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = F(X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $X \\to$ the number entered also called a feature\n",
    "   * $Y \\to$ the outcome we want to predict\n",
    "   * $F \\to$ the model that gets the job done\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to classical programming where we the program function, in Machine Learning we learn the function by training the algorithm with data. \n",

    "Machine learning algorithms can be categorized based on different criteria. In this tutorial, our categorization will be based on the amount and type of supervision needed during the training process. Based on this criterion, there are four major categories; supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We shall limit our definition to the first two;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning**: this refers to tasks where we have a specific outcome to predict. That is, every observation of the features has a corresponding outcome. An example of a supervised learning task is predicting snow depth based on some influencing features.\n",

    "* **Unsupervised Learning**: this refers to tasks where we have no outcome to predict.  Here, rather than predict an outcome, we seek to understand the relationship between the features or between the observations or to detect anomalous observations. Considering the example above, we assume the snow depth variable does not exist and we either understand the relationship between the features or between the observations based on the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that a variable can either be categorical or continuous. For now, let's focus on the nature of the outcome variable. In *Supervised Learning* parlance, if the outcome variable is categorical, we have a *classification* task and if continuous, we are in the presence of a *regression* task. Categorical implies that the variable is made of distinct categories (e.g. hair color: grey, blonde, black) and continuous implies that the variable is measured (e.g. snow depth). For the rest of this tutorial, we will focus on *Supervised Learning* tasks with a special concentration on regression tasks.\n",

    "**Tensorflow**: it is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It makes it easy to train and deploy machine learning models. TensorFlow was created at Google and supports many of their large-scale Machine Learning applications. Read more at [About TensorFlow](https://keras.io/about/)\n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  $\\texttt{C:\\Users\\Default> pip install keras}$\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you will be able to continue with the tutorial. For this tutorial, both Tensorflow and Keras used are version 2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Machine Learning techniques can be characterised as either *parametric* or *non-parametric*. A common parametric method is Linear Regression while Neural Networks are a common non-parametric method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume a functional form for $f$, e.g we may assume that $f$ is a linear function of $X$:\n",

    "$$f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_k X_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the goal of ML is to estimate the parameters of the model $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\cdots, \\beta_k$. This is called Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parametric approach simplifies the problem of estimating $f$ to a parameter estimation problem. The disadvantage is that we assume a particular shape of $f$ that may not match the true shape of $f$. The major advantage of using parametric approach that when inference is the goal we can understand how changing $X_1, X_2, \\cdots, X_k$ effects $Y$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we estimate the true outcome ($Y$) using a trained ML algorithm ($f(X)$), the discrepancy between the observed and predicted must be quantified. The question is, how do we quantify this discrepancy? This brings the notion of **loss function**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Loss Function* $\\mathcal{L} (\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a bivariate function that quantifies the loss (error) we sustain from predicting $Y$ with $f(X)$. Put another way, **loss function** quantifies how close the prediction $f(X)$ is to the ground truth $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists quite a number of ways for which the loss of a regression problem may be quantified. We now illustrate two of them;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} (Y,f(X)) = (Y - f(X))^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is popularly known as the *squared error loss* and it is simply the square of the difference between the observed and the predicted values. The loss is squared so that the function reaches its minimum (convex).\n",

    "2.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} (Y,f(X)) = |Y - f(X)|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to quantify regression loss is by taking the absolute value of the difference between the observed ($Y$) and the predicted ($f(X)$) values. This is called the L1 loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that the *loss function* as defined above corresponds to a single observation. However, in practice, we want to quantify the loss over the entire dataset and this is where the notion of **empirical risk** comes in. Loss quantified over the entire dataset is called the *empirical risk*. Our goal in ML is to develop an algorithm such that the *empirical risk* is as minimum as possible. *Empirical risk* is also called the *cost function* or the *objective function* we want to minimize.\n",

    "The configuration of the hidden layer(s) controls the complexity of the network. A NN may contain more than one hidden layer. A NN with more than one hidden layer is called a **deep neural network** while that with a single hidden layer is a **shallow neural network**. The final layer of a neural network is called the output layer and it holds the predicted outcomes of observations passed into the input layer. Every inter-neuron connection has an associated weight, these weights are what the neural network learns during the training process. When connections between the layers do not form a loop, such networks are called **feedforward neural networks** and if otherwise, they are called **recurrent neural networks**. In this tutorial, we shall concentrate on the feed forward neural networks.\n",

It is a parametric approach that lives up its name: it assumes a linear relationship between the outcome and the predictors. When only one predictor is involved, it is called $\\texttt{Simple Linear Regression}$ and when more than one predictor is involved, it is called $\\texttt{Multiple Linear Regression}$. For illustration purpose, the multiple linear regression will be used. \n",

In our case, $y_i$ is continuous. Mathematically, the predicted value ($\\hat{y}$) from the linear regression is given as;\n",

The OLS approach provides a closed-form (formula) solution to the empirical risk minimization problem. In this tutorial, we shall state the closed form solution without proof. The closed form solution to the empirical risk minimization problem is written as;\n",

    "This is repeated for the bias and every single weight. The $\\eta$ in step 2(B) of the gradient descent algorithm is called the learning rate. It is a measure of how fast we descend the hill (since we are moving from large to small errors). Large learning rates may cause divergence and very small learning rates may take too many iterations before convergence."
