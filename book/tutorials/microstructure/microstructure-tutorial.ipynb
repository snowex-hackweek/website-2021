    "## Fun Facts About Snow Microstructure\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow microstructure plays a super important role in snow physics and snow remote sensing, so a lot of effort went towards measuring it in SnowEx 2020!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different quantities that are used to measure snow microstructure, including \"grain size\". Grain size measurements are challenging to make in a repeatable way, and are also challenging to relate to the physical quantities that control remote sensing measurements. In the last ~15 years or so, a lot of effort has gone into more objective ways to measure microstructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow microstructure  governs response of remote sensing to snow cover for visible, near-infrared and high-frequency microwave wavelengths. See Figure 1, below, and read {cite:p}`Dozier2009`, for more information.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Snow microstructure governs visible and near-infrared reflectance. This is figure 2 from {cite:p}`Dozier2009`</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Radar measurements such as those made by the Ku-band SWEARR instrument are also very sensitive to snow microstructure. \n",

    "<b>Modeled response of radar backscatter to SWE and single-scatter albedo (which in turn is a function of snow microstructure), based on a simple model suggested by {cite:p}`Ulaby2014`</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow microstructure is super important to efforts to launch a Ku-band SAR to measure global snow water equivalent (SWE). An important area of research right now is exploring how to use estimates of microstructure (e.g. from snowpack evolution models) to improve SWE retrievals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow microstructure evolves through the season, and varies a lot with depth. Snow microstructure evolution is controlled by other snow properties, such as snow temperature, snow height and snow liquid water content. A really great resource on snow microstructure is Kelly Elder's recent talks:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Basic Microstructure Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Microstructure definitions take a bit of getting used to. It's very easy to get confused. Specific surface area (SSA) is one of the most important quantity used to measure snow microstructure, so that's the focus here. Note that SSA is not the be-all and end-all, so there's a short table describing how to relate SSA to other quantities just below.  A couple of good reads on all of this is {cite:p}`Matzler2002` and {cite:p}`Matzl2010`.\n",

    "<b>Coarse and fine snow microstructure revealed by microCT. The microCT snow renderings on the left are Figure 2 from {cite:p}`Lowe2011`. The colorbars indicate that fine-grained snow (a) has high SSA and low D<sub>eq</sub>, whereas coarse-grained snow (b) has low SSA and high D<sub>eq</sub>.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Figure 3 above to ground these definitions: SSA is the surface area of the ice-air interface, normalized in some way. Confusingly, SSA is defined in a couple of different ways in the literature: sometimes, surface area within a particular volume of interest (VOI) is normalized by the mass of the ice in the VOI. As defined in this way, SSA has units of length squared per mass, usually expressed as m<sup>2</sup>/kg. Instead of normalizing by mass, SSA is sometimes defined by normalizing by the volume of the VOI (this is SSA<sub>v</sub> in {cite:p}`Matzl2010`), and sometimes by normalizing by the volume of the ice in the VOI (this is SSA<sub>i</sub> in {cite:p}`Matzl2010`, and q in {cite:p}`Matzler2002`). Here let's just go with the first definition I mentioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SSA = \\frac{\\text{Surface area of ice-air interface}}{\\text{Mass of ice}} \\quad\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "SSA tends to take values between 5 and 150 m<sup>2</sup>/kg: fresh, fine-grained snow has high SSA, and coarse snow has low SSA. Because it takes a little while for SSA values to become intuitive, a useful derived metric is the equivalent grain diameter (D<sub>eq</sub>; note that this is identical to D<sub>q</sub> in {cite:p}`Matzler2002`), which by definition is the diameter that a sphere would have if it had a particular value of SSA. This is a one-to-one relationship, so there are no assumptions involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_{eq} = \\frac{6}{SSA \\rho_i} \\quad\n",

    "Relationships of specific surface area to other metrics are given in this list if you're curious but otherwise just skip past this bit\n",
    "* Sometimes people refer to the \"optical grain diameter\", which is the same as D<sub>eq</sub>. The \"optical\" refers to {cite:p}`Grenfell1999`, who showed that any snow with a particular SSA had similar (not identical) radiative transfer properties regardless of particle shape in the visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum. But note the same is not true in the microwave spectrum. \n",
    "* Autocorrelation length is usually one of two metrics that summarize the two-point microstructure autocorelation function of the three-dimensional ice-air matrix. Think of the probability that you change media (from ice to air or vice versa) as you move a certain distance within the snow microstructure. The length that defines the likelihood that you'll change media is (an approximation of the correlation length). SSA is by definition (with almost no assumptions) equal to the slope of the autocorrelation function at the origin. But microwave scattering is controlled by correlations at longer lags. For more check out {cite:p}`Matzler2002`. The lack of closing the loop between SSA and correlation length is a significant issue when we have measurements of SSA and microwaves as we do in SnowEx.\n",
    "* Geometric grain size is what we usually measure when we measure with a hand lens. You can try to relate it to SSA or corelation length, but it is not always possible, and will change with different observers. \n",

    "### Microstructure Instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what we're trying to measure (SSA, or correlation length) how do we actually measure? let's talk just about three techniques used in SnowEx 2020 Grand Mesa. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/microCT.png\" alt=\"ct-figure\" width=\"800px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Left: Lauren Farnsworth transports microCT samples from field sites back to Grand Mesa Lodge in a cold storage container. Right: the microCT machine in the lab at CRREL.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Micro-computed tomography (microCT) is the only laboratory-based method used here, and it is the gold standard, although it does still come with caveats. The idea of microCT is to remove a sample of snow from a snow pit face, and either cast it with a compound such as diethyl pthalate that is still a liquid at 0° C, or preserve the same at a very cold temperature. Then the sample is sent back to the laboratory, and bombared with x-rays, similar to how you get x-rays to see if a bone is broken at the doctor. For much more on microCT, check out {cite:p}`Heggli2011`. microCT can be used to extract a ton of information about snow microstructure, including SSA, correlation length and many others. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/IntegratingSpheres.png\" alt=\"ct-figure\" width=\"800px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Left: Kehan Yang operates an IceCube unit at the Grand Mesa Lodge intercomparison snowpit. Top right: schematic showing the integrating sphere measurement principle, from {cite:p}`Gallet2009`. Bottom right: snow in the IceCube sampling container, from {cite:p}`Leppanen2018`. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating spheres are field-based and you make the measurements on samples extracted from the snowpit face. The principle of the measurement is based on firing a laser at the snow sample, within a special reflective hollow sphere, where one side is filled by the snow sample, and measuring how much of the laser is reflected at a sensor at a known geometry. For more information, check out {cite:p}`Gallet2009`.  Most integrating sphere measurements are either made by a commercial firm (A2 Photonics) known as the [IceCube](https://a2photonicsensors.com/icecube-ssa/) or a version constructed at the University of Sherbrooke known as the IRIS {cite:p}`Montpetit2012`. These approaches are set up to measure SSA only. There were three of these at Grand Mesa - one of the Sherbrooke IRIS units, and two IceCubes, one from Finnish Meteorological Institute, and one from Ohio State University.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/SMP.png\" alt=\"ct-figure\" width=\"800px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Left: Megan Mason operates the SMP. Right: Closeup of the SMP sensor tip.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow micropenetrometers are also a field-based approach, but they do not require a snowpit, enabling far more observations to be made. Instead, an automated motor pushes a probe vertically downwards into the snowpack. The probe measures the force required to break snow microstructure, yielding a wealth of information. Snow density, specific surface area and correlation length can be retrieved; for background see {cite:p}`Lowe2012` and {cite:p}`Proksch2015`. The micropen effort at Grand Mesa was led by Boise State University. A key thing to be aware of is that differences in the various SMP instruments mean that the empirical relationship of {cite:p}`Proksch2015` will give quite poor results for the particular instrument used in SnowEx, as fully explained in {cite:p}`Calonne2020`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are not the only ways to measure microstructure! There are several others not mentioned here, but not used at Grand Mesa 2020. Ask if interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SnowEx Microstructure Measurement Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the three methods described above, microCT is by far the most expensive and most time consuming. Samples have to be transported back to the laboratory and the processing time requires a microCT machine. Thus the fewest CT sapmles are taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "The integrating spheres require a snowpit to be dug, so we have an intermediate number of them: ~100. \n",
    "\n",
    "The micropen measurements are by far the fastest to make, so a cross pattern of SMP measurements was made on orthogonal directions intersecting at the snowpit. There are thousands of SMP profiles from Grand Mesa 2020."

    "We're going to do two things! First, we'll intercompare the three different integrating sphere instruments at four different pits where we had multiple instruments operating. We'd expect these data to be fairly self-consistent. Second, we'll compare all three methods (integrating sphere, SMP and microCT) at a single pit where we had all of these measurements present. Here especially with the SMP we would expect to need to intercalibrate the data to match local conditions; so far SSA has only been fit to SMP force measurements in one study, and we should assume we'll need a local calibration to get a tight fit."

Comparing with {cite:p}`Calonne2020` shows that the SMP is off in the same direction as diagnosed in that paper. Thus, the difference is most likely due to the difference in SMP instruments. Dr. Mel Sandells of Northumbria University has a github branch of the SMP software SnowMicropyn that has the newer fit relationship integrated in the software. It would be a nice project to loop in Mel's branch with this notebook and see how well things compare to SnowEx data. I'd be happy to help anyone interested get rolling on that!\n",

    "Some of the ways that you could imagine connecting microstructure measurements to other quantities would be with the SWESARR radar data. Although the radar data does seem to have some orthorectification issues that haven't been fully worked out, I can imagine these being worked around by careful choice of places you match up the microstructure to the radar. Note that places that are shallower tend to have larger D<sub>eq</sub> and vice versa, and the spatial variability in SSA was fairly low in general in Grand Mesa 2020, so looking at multiple SSA vs radar samples might not yield a great correlation. But you never know, could be fun to try! Generally speaking, we don't expect a ton of impact of the microstructure on L-band (UAVSAR), but it would be interesting to explore that.\n",
