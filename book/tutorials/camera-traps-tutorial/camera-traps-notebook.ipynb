    "## What is a camera trap?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A camera trap (sometimes referred to as a remote camera or hunting camera) is similar to a normal camera except they:\n",
    "    - 1) can detect  and take pictures when motion is in their vicinity. \n",
    "    - 2) can take pictures at consistent intervals at settings preset by the user.  \n",
    "    - 3) are designed to withstand harsh conditions and to be left up for long periods of time.  \n",
    "- Their potential for snow hydrology is exciting. Consistent daily camera trap photos can be analyzed contiously to form a *time-lapse* of snow conditions at one location. They can operate in sub-freezing temperatures and during storms -- conditions when access with other types of measurements would have been difficult. "
